                    <h2>Creation of KazSSR and First Constitution</h2>
                    <p>On <b>December 5, 1936</b>, the <i>Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (KASSR)</i>, formed in 1920, was transformed 
                        into the Union Republic of the USSR. In this regard, on March 24, 1937, the Extraordinary X Congress of 
                        Soviets of Kazakhstan adopted the <i>first Constitution of the Kazakh SSR.</i><br>
                        <br>
                        The first Constitution of the Kazakh SSR was built in full accordance with the Constitution of the USSR, 
                        consisted of <b>11 chapters and 125 articles</b>. It reflected the creation of the foundations of socialism in the 
                        republic, the establishment of public ownership of the means of production and the planned economy, the 
                        elimination of exploitation and the formation of equal relations. The Constitution of the Kazakh SSR of 1937 
                        legislatively consolidated the unification of Kazakhstan with other republics of the USSR in order to provide 
                        mutual assistance in the line of economic and political defense.

                    <p>A landmark event in the history of Kazakh culture was the First Decade of Kazakh art and literature in Moscow. 
                        Evgeny Brusilovsky's operas based on folk music - <b>"Kyz-Zhibek"</b> and <b>"Zhalbyr"</b> were shown on the stage of Moscow

                    <h2>Deportation of peoples</h2>
                    <p>In the mid-30s, one of the forms of political repression against social and ethnic groups became deportations - 
                        the forced eviction of a large mass of people to a remote and unfamiliar area. With the approach of the war, 
                        entire peoples who, according to the country's leadership, were considered unreliable began to be deported. 
                        One of the main places of resettlement of the deportees was the territory of the Kazakh SSR.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 1936, 15,000 Polish and German families were evicted from the border zone of Ukraine to Kazakhstan. A year 
                        later, more than 95 thousand Koreans from the Far East were sent to Kazakhstan. On August 28, 1941, after the 
                        liquidation of the Autonomous Republic of the Volga Germans, the largest deportation action was launched. In 
                        six months, more than <b>1 million 30 thousand</b> Germans were resettled from all over the USSR to remote areas of 
                        Siberia and Kazakhstan (445 thousand of them settled in the Kazakh SSR). In the autumn of 1943, operations for 
                        the resettlement of the North Caucasian peoples began. Initially, Karachay residents were resettled, and in 
                        February 1944, during Operation Lentil, <b>496,000</b> Chechens and Ingush were deported to the Kazakh SSR and the 
                        Kyrgyz SSR in 15 days. In subsequent years, <b>Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Balkars, Meskhetian Turks,</b> and <b>Kurds</b> were 
                        also deported to Kazakhstan.

                            On April 26, 1937, an article "On the occasion of bourgeois nationalists" was published in the All-Union newspaper Pravda. Its 
                            author, journalist Pukhov, actually accused the leadership of the Kazakh SSR in the absence of mass arrests of 
                            "counter-revolutionary nationalists." The article intensified the growth of suspicion and distrust and became the impetus for the 
                            launch of a mechanism of mass repression in Kazakhstan. A few months before that, the directive of the NKVD of the USSR 
                            "On intelligence and operational work on anti-Soviet Turkic-Tatar nationalist organizations" was issued, which affected all the 
                            eastern republics of the USSR. The peak of arrests in the Kazakh SSR occurred in October-December 1937. The punitive authorities 
                            first of all dealt with their long-time opponents - the Alashordins. In 1937-1938, A. Bukeikhanov, A. Baitursynov, M. Zhumabaev, 
                            M. Tynyshpaev, brothers Zhansha and Khalel Dosmukhamedov and other figures of the Alash autonomy were arrested and shot.<br>
                            <br>
                            Their opponents also fell under the wave of repression. Fighters for the establishment of Soviet power and prominent party 
                            figures were declared enemies of the people: People's Commissar of Education of the Kazakh SSR T. Zhurgenov, Deputy Chairman of 
                            the SNK of the RSFSR (Deputy Prime Minister) T. Ryskulov, Deputy Chairman of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences S. Asfendiyarov, 
                            head of the Press Department of the Central Committee of the CP(b) of Kazakhstan A. Rozybakiev. The founders of Kazakh Soviet 
                            literature S. Seifullin, B. Mailin, I. Zhansugurov also fell under the ice rink of repression. The First Secretary of Kazakhstan 
                            Levon Mirzoyan did not escape arrest and execution either. In addition to the country's leadership and representatives of the 
                            national intelligentsia, thousands of civil servants and public figures were arrested. Several public trials were held in the 
                            Kazakh SSR, including the Karaganda case, in which 400 people were repressed. In two years, more than 100 thousand people were 
                            repressed in the republic. About 25 thousand of them were shot.

                        It was established on the basis of the <i>Kazakh branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences</i> (until 1938 - the Kazakh 
                        base of the USSR Academy of Sciences). Until the 40s, 11 research and design institutes already worked in 
                        Kazakhstan, but there was a shortage of personnel: out of 100 employees of the Kazakh branch of the USSR 
                        Academy of Sciences, only three had a doctorate degree, 14 were candidates of sciences. Kazakh scientists 
                        conducted research in the field of biology, history and ethnography, mineral exploration.</p>

    <h2>Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan</h2>
    <p><b>October 25, 1990</b> is the day of sovereignty, which became a turning point in Kazakhstan's History. The first fundamental 
        legislative act of the country was the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>. It is a legal, political and ideological document 
        reflecting the basic principles of the public, human rights and freedoms, property, political pluralism and separation of 
        powers. These fundamental provisions formed the basis of the <b>Constitution</b>.<br>
        <br>
        On <b>December 16, 1991</b>, Kazakhstan adopted the Constitutional Law on Independence in the <b><i>Republic of Kazakhstan.</i></b></p>
