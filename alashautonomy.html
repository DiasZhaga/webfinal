                        led the work of the Muslim faction in the State Duma. On their initiative, the magazine <i>"Aikap"</i> (1911), the 
                        newspapers <i>"Birlik tuy", "Sary-Arka", "Ak Zhol"</i> were created, which conducted extensive propaganda and 
                        educational work on their pages. The main goal of the Alash movement was self-government of the Kazakh people, 
                        the right of the people to create an independent state, restriction of resettlement from the interior of Russia 
                        to the Kazakh lands. Representatives of the Alash movement advocated the preservation of traditional animal 
                        husbandry, the development of agriculture, industry, and trade relations. A significant place in their program 
                        was occupied by the development of national culture, education and the Kazakh language. The Alash movement, 
                        which arose during the revolution of 1905 â€” 1907 in Russia, reached its peak in 1917.</p>

        <h4 class="text-dark"><strong>Ideological resistance and the trace of the Soviet Era.</strong></h4>
        <p>Despite the fact that all political structures were destroyed by the Bolsheviks, the Alash movement did not immediately 
            leave the arena of political struggle. His principles were supported by <b>T.Ryskulov, S.Asfendiyarov, S.Kozhanov, 
            S.Sadvakasov</b> and <b>Zh.Mynbayev.</b><br><br>

            A number of leaders of the Alash movement did not leave the arena of ideological activity. According to a number of sources,
             in 1920 A. Bukeikhanov urged young people who were exposed to the ideas of "Alash" and had not been seen before in open 
             speeches against the Soviet government to join the Bolshevik Party, gain the confidence of the new government and thereby 
             serve national interests. In the conditions of Soviet power, this call of the leader of the Kazakh intelligentsia was a 
             kind of way out of the current situation. Dozens of Alashev residents, including <b>S. Sadvokasov, Y. Mustambayuly, 
             Zh. Sultanbekov, N. Nurmakov,</b> having joined the ranks of the Bolshevik Party, participating in the exercise of supreme 
             power, thereby made every effort to ensure that Soviet power in Kazakhstan acquired national content.
            Since the mid-20s of the twentieth century, in parallel, an official campaign was conducted to distort the key issues 
            of the history of the Kazakh people (the history of Kazakhstan's accession to Russia and the national liberation movement in the region), "commissioned" studies on them were written.
            The response to this violence in spiritual life was the publication of such works of Kazakh history and literature as 
            <i>"The History of the division of the Kazakh land"</i>, <i>"The History of the Kazakh people"</i> by <b>Telzhan Shonanov</b> and <i>"Former 
            Foreigners"</i> by <b>Koshke Kemengerov</b>, <i>"Materials for the History of the Kyrgyz-Kazakh people"</i> and <i>"Aktaban shubyndy"</i> 
            (Great Disasters) <b>M. Tynyshpaev</b>, collections "Alaman" and "Isatai-Makhambet", compiled and published 
            by <b>X. Dosmukhamedov</b> et al., who have not lost their scientific and cognitive significance at the present time.</p>

        <p>Later, the relations of the Alash party with the new government turned to constant contacts and compromises. Having soberly 
            assessed the situation, the leaders of Alash accepted the conditions dictated by the Soviet military and political 
            leadership. <b>A. Baitursynov</b>, after meeting with V.I. Lenin in <b>1919</b>, was included in the composition of the extraordinary 
            regional body - the <b>Kirghiz Military Revolutionary Committee (KirVRK)</b>, whose power, however, often turned out to be only 
            nominal. In fact, the management was carried out by the bodies of the Turkestan Front, and then by party committees, in 
            which the leading role was played by the Bolsheviks sent from the center.<br>
            <br>After the victory in the civil war, the Soviet government disbanded the government of the Alash Horde, later the leaders of the Alash Horde were subjected to repression by the Stalinist regime.</p>
